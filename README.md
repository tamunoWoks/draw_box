# Box Drawing Script  

### Description  
This Python script allows a user to draw a **hollow rectangular box** on the console.  
- The user chooses a **single-character symbol**, along with the **width** and **height** of the box.  
- The script validates the inputs to make sure the box can be drawn correctly.  
- If the input is valid, the box is displayed. If not, an **exception message** is shown.  

This project demonstrates:  
- Input validation  
- Exception handling  
- String manipulation for ASCII art  

### Features  
- Draws a hollow rectangular box using any symbol.  
- Validates that the symbol is a **single character**.  
- Ensures **width and height > 2** for a proper box.  
- Graceful error handling with **try/except** blocks.  
- Modular code with a `box()` function and a `main()` function.
